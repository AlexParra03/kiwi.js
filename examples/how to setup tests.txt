For the meantime this is the easiest way to get Kiwi Tests running in your browser:

1) Install a web server that can run PHP. On Windows WampServer is excellent and free: http://www.wampserver.com/en/
2) When the web server is running create an alias so that http://192.168.0.1/kiwi/ maps to the kiwi folder in the git repo.
3) Create a second alias so that http://192.168.0.1/kiwitests/ maps to the tests folder in the git repo.

It doesn't matter if the IP address is different in your set-up. All that matters is that if you go to /kiwi/ you can see the core Kiwi files.

If you now browse to kiwitests, and have php running properly, then you should see the Kiwi Test Suite page.

Pick any test from the list to run it.
